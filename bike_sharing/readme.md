## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using bike sharing systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Therefore, Bike sharing systems  function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city.

In this project, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

For this project, it is highly recommended to use Sagemaker Studio from the course provided AWS workspace. This will simplify much of the installation needed to get started.

For local development, you will need to setup a jupyter lab instance and install following packages:

```
Python 3.7
MXNet 1.8
Pandas >= 1.2.4
AutoGluon 0.2.0 
```
